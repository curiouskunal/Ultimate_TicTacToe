\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Input}
		
\paragraph{Click on cell of inner board}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: It is the start of a new game and the board is empty
					
Input: A click on any cell of any inner tic tac toe board
					
Output: That cell should have the user's character on it
					
How test will be performed: This test will be performed automatically with the use of the Karma Unit Test. In the test, an element will be clicked and then the inner html of the text will be checked to see if it is updated to the character that represents that person's turn. There will also be a check on the variable that stores the all game information to see that it is updated.
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Static etc.
					
Initial State: Opponent has played on a inner board and it is the user's turn
					
Input: The user attempts to click on a tile that they are not designated to click based on the rules of the game
					
Output: The board should not change at all. The game data should not change and it is still the user's turn
					
How test will be performed: This test will be done automatically with theuse of the Karma Unit Test. When the use clicks on a inner board that they cannot select, the javascript will prevent anything from changing in the game data

\item{test-id3\\}

Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic
					
Initial State: Opponent has played on a inner board and it is the user's turn
					
Input: The user attempts to click on a tile that has already been clicked previously
					
Output: The board should not change at all. The game data should not change and it is still the user's turn
					
How test will be performed: This test will be performed automatically with the use of the Karma Unit Test. In the test, an element in the inner board they are meant to click is already selected previously will be clicked. There will be no change to the board as the cell was previously selected. The script will not change anything as that cell is not a null value, it has the character representing the player that selected it.

\section{Appendix}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

This is a section that would be appropriate for some teams.
