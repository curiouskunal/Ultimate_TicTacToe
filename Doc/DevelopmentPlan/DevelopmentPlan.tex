\maketitle

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a variation on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. It is 
simply multiple games of Tic Tac Toe running simultaneously to make a clasic 
game that often ends in a draw have an exciting ending.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Our Team will be meeting 4 times a week; twice during lab hours and twice 
outside of lab. Out of lab meetings will take place in a few locations such as
Thode Library, Health Sciences Library, team member?s homes or via online 
 mediums such as Skype. During each meeting minutes will be taken down. 
 This will recap what was done during the meeting, what we have done since the 
last meeting and what we plan to accomplish before the next meeting.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
All team communication about setting group
meetings and project related communication will occur on the FaceBook messenger
group chat. Skype will be used to conduct ''virtual'' face to face eetings
outside of lab. Git issues will be used for setting milestones, delegating tasks
and reporting bugs in the program.

\section{Team Member Roles}
During every meeting one member (alternating) will
be the meeting facilitator. This role consists of fill out the \href{run:3XA3
Meeting Summary Template.docx}{\textcolor{blue}{meeting minutes word document}}
and saving a PDF copy to the git repository. Other Member roles are distributed
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Kunal: Developer, LaTex Technology Expert, HTML, CSS Expert 
  \item Pareek: Developer,Git Technology Expert, JavaScript Expert 

\end{itemize}

\section{Git Workflow Plan}
Our team will be using a Master only git workflow. This means all code will be pushed 
to the master branch. Every milestone commit will be tagged with its predefined identifier.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan} The proof of concept demonstration
will involve the fundamental game dynamics  fully working. This will include the
logic to determine if a move is valid, if a  player has taken control of one
inner board and if a player has won the entire  game. It will also have user
inputs from the same local machine for up to 5  moves each. One possible
difficulty is the testing with the Karma Unit Testing  tool as it is something
that we have never used before. We hope to implement  this game using a local
server so people can play the game on their own devices.  This will be an
additional feature to add if the time frame permits it because  of the
complexity of it. We do not foresee any difficulties in installing  external
libraries. The aim is to have this application running on all forms of  devices;
mobile, tablet and computer. With modifications to the CSS, this should  be
achievable.

\section{Technology}
Technologies that will be used include:

\begin{itemize}

  \item Git
  \item LaTex
  \item Javascript
  \item HTML
  \item CSS
  \item JsDoc documentation generation
  \item Karma Javascript Unit Testing 

\end{itemize}
