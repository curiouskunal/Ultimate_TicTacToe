\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Our Team will be meeting 4 times a week; twice during lab hours and twice outside of lab. Out of lab meetings will take place in a 
few locations such as Thode Library, Health Sciences Library, team member?s homes or via online mediums such as skype. 
During each meeting minutes will be taken down. This will recap what was done during the meeting, what we have done since the 
last meeting and what we plan to accomplish before the next meeting. \\

\section{Team Communication Plan}
All team communication about setting group meetings and project related communication will occur on the Facebook messenger

delegating tasks and reporting bugs in the program. \\
