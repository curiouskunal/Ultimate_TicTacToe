# Ultimate_TicTacToe

Team Members: Pareek Ravi, Kunal Shah

This project is a reimplementation of [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/kennycason/ultimate_tictactoe)

Project description:

* Problem: Kids are too smart, to entertain a child for more than 10 min, tic tac toe doesnâ€™t cut it any more.

* Solution: A game that is one step further than the original tic tac toe, with added strategy but still has the simplicity of the original game.
