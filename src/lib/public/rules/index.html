                Everyone is familiar with this classic 9-square grid tic-tac-toe.<br/>
                In Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, you are going to be plaing 10 games at the same time.<br/>

                As you can see there are 9 smaller grids within each of those large squares in the blue board.<br/>
                To win the game, you need to get three larger squares in a row. <br/>
                To win a large square, you have to get three small squares in a row.<br/>

                Here’s how it works. Say X goes first <br/>
                For the first move they can go anywhere on the board they would like.

                Now, just like in normal tic-tac-toe, O goes next. But O can’t just go anywhere. <br/>
                X’s move determines which of the smaller grids O can play on.<br/>
                Since X went in the bottom right corner within the small grid, O must go in the bottom right corner of the large grid
